[Istio](https://istio.io) is a service mesh, or a network of microservices, that can handle tasks such as load balancing, service-to-service authentication, monitoring, etc. It does this by deploying sidecar proxies to intercept network data, which causes little disruption to your current application.

Istio is also a platform with its own API and feature set that can help you run a distributed microservice architecture. Istio is a tool that you can deploy with few to no code changes to your applications allowing you to harness its power without disrupting your development cycle. In conjunction with Kubernetes, Istio provides you with insights into your cluster leading to more control over your applications.

In this guide:

- Setup a [Kubernetes Cluster](#setup-your-kubernetes-cluster), [Helm, and Tiller](#install-helm-and-tiller)
- [Install Istio with Helm Charts](#install-helm-charts)
- [Setup Envoy Proxies](#set-up-envoy-proxies)
- [Install the Istio Bookinfo App](#install-the-istio-bookinfo-app)
- [Visualize data with Istio's Grafana addon](#visualizations-with-grafana)

{{< caution >}}
This guideâ€™s example instructions will create several billable resources on your Linode account. If you do not want to keep using the example cluster that you create, be sure to delete it when you have finished the guide.

If you remove the resources afterward, you will only be billed for the hour(s) that the resources were present on your account. Consult the [Billing and Payments](https://www.linode.com/docs/platform/billing-and-support/billing-and-payments/)  guide for detailed information about how hourly billing works and for a table of plan pricing.

## Before You Begin

Familiarize yourself with Kubernetes with our series [A Beginner's Guide to Kubernetes](/docs/applications/containers/kubernetes/beginners-guide-to-kubernetes/) and [Advantaged of Using Kubernetes](/docs/applications/containers/kubernetes/kubernetes-use-cases/).

## Setup Your Kubernetes Cluster

There are many ways to setup a Kubernetes cluster. This guide will use the Linode k8s-alpha CLI. To set it up, see the
[How to Deploy Kubernetes on Linode with the k8s-alpha CLI](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/containers/kubernetes/how-to-deploy-kubernetes-on-linode-with-k8s-alpha-cli/) and follow the steps up until the Create a Cluster section.

1.  For this guide you will need 3 worker nodes and one master. Now that you have the Linode k8s-alpha CLI ready you can easily deploy a cluster using the following command:

        linode-cli k8s-alpha create istio-cluster --node-type g6-standard-2 --nodes 3 --master-type g6-standard-2 --region us-east --ssh-public-key $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

1.  After the cluster is created you should see output that ends similar to this:

    {{< output >}}
Apply complete! Resources: 5 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Switched to context "istio-cluster-ka4OLOcgqHw@istio-cluster".
Your cluster has been created and your kubectl context updated.

Try the following command:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

Come hang out with us in #linode on the Kubernetes Slack! http://slack.k8s.io/
{{</ output >}}

1.  If you visit the [Linode Cloud Manager](https://cloud.linode.com/), you will see your newly created cluster nodes on the Linodes page.

### Install Helm and Tiller

Follow the instructions in [How to Install Apps on Kubernetes with Helm](https://www.linode.com/docs/applications/containers/kubernetes/how-to-install-apps-on-kubernetes-with-helm/) to install Helm and Tiller to your cluster. Stop before the section on Using Helm Charts to Install Apps.

## Install Istio

For Linux or macOS users, use curl to pull the Istio project files. You will want to do this even though you will use Helm charts to deploy Istio to our cluster because you want to get the sample `Bookinfo` application that comes with bundled with this installation.

    curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | ISTIO_VERSION=1.3.3 sh -

If you are using Windows, you will need to go to Istio's [Github repo](https://github.com/istio/istio/releases) to find the download. Here you will find the latest releases for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

{{< note >}}
This will create a new directory `istio-1.3.3` wherever you use this command. Therefore, if you don't want this directory to be in your home directory, first move to the directory where you want it to be and then use the command.
{{< /note >}}

### Install Helm Charts

1.  Add the Istio Helm repo:

        helm repo add istio.io https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-release/releases/1.3.2/charts/

1.  Update the helm repo listing:

        helm repo update

1.  Check that you have the repo with the following command:

        helm repo list | grep istio.io

1.  The output should be similar to the following:

    {{< output >}}
istio.io	https://storage.googleapis.com/istio-release/releases/1.3.2/charts/
{{< /output >}}

1.  Install Istio's [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/#customresourcedefinitions) with the helm chart:

        helm install --name istio-init --namespace istio-system istio.io/istio-init

    This also creates a pod namespace called `istio-system` which you will continue to use for the remainder of this guide.

1.  Verify that all CRDs were successfully installed by running the following command:

        kubectl get crds | grep 'istio.io' | wc -l

1.  You should see the following output:

    {{< output >}}
23
{{< /output >}}

       If the number is less, you may need to wait a few moments for the resources to finish being created.

1.  Install the Helm chart for Istio. There are [many installation options available](https://istio.io/docs/reference/config/installation-options/) for Istio. For this guide you are setting the Grafana option to use the visualization later.

        helm install --name istio --namespace istio-system istio.io/istio --set grafana.enabled=true

{{< /output >}}
{{< /disclosure-note >}}

1.  Verify that the Istio services and Grafana are running with this command:

        kubectl get svc -n istio-system

1.  The output should be similar to this:

    {{< output >}}

{{</ output >}}

1.  You can also see the pods running by using this command:

        kubectl get pods -n istio-system

1.  The output will look similar to this:

    {{< output >}}

{{< /output >}}

1.  Before moving on, be sure that all pods are in the `Running` or `Completed` status.

{{< note >}}
If you need to troubleshoot, you can check a specific pod by using `kubectl`, remembering that you set the namespace to `istio-system`:

    kubectl describe pods pod_name -n pod_namespace

And check the logs by using:

    kubectl logs pod_name -n pod_namespace
{{< /note >}}
### Set up Envoy Proxies

1.  Istio's service mesh runs by employing *sidecar proxies*. You will enable them by injecting them into the containers with the following command:

        kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled

    Notice that this command is using the `default` namespace which is where you will be deploying the `Bookinfo` application.

    {{< note >}}
This deployment uses automatic sidecar injection. Automatic injection can be disabled and [manual injection](https://istio.io/docs/setup/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#manual-sidecar-injection) enabled during installation via `istioctl`. If you disabled automatic injection during installation, use the following command to modify the `bookinfo.yaml` file before deploying the application:

    kubectl apply -f <(istioctl kube-inject -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml)
{{< /note >}}

1.  Verify that it applied the `enabled` label to the `default` namespace with the following command:

        kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection

1.  You will get similar output:

    {{< output >}}
NAME           STATUS   AGE    ISTIO-INJECTION
default        Active   101m   enabled
istio-system   Active   37m
kube-public    Active   101m
kube-system    Active   101m
{{< /output>}}

## Install the Istio Bookinfo App

The Bookinfo app is a sample application that comes packaged with Istio. It features four microservices in four different languages that are all separate from Istio itself. The application is a simple single page website that displays a "book store" catalog page with one book, it's details, and some reviews. The microservices are:

- `productpage` is written in Python and calls `details` and `reviews` to populate the page.
- `details` is written in Ruby and contains the book information.
- `reviews` is written in Java and contains book reviews and calls `ratings`.
- `ratings` is written in Node.js and contains book ratings. There are three versions of this microservice in the application. A different version is called each time the page is refreshed.

1.  Navigate to the directory where you [installed Istio](#install-istio).

1.  The `bookinfo.yaml` file is the application manifest. It specifies all the service and deployment objects for the application. Here is just the `productpage` section of this file, feel free to look at the entire file:

    {{< file "samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml" >}}

        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9080
---
{{< /file >}}

1.  Start the `Bookinginfo` application with the following command:

        kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml

1.  The following output results:

    {{< output >}}
service/details created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v1 created
jdeployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created
service/productpage created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
{{< /output >}}

1.  Check that all the services are up and running:

        kubectl get services

1.  The output will look similar to the following:

    {{< output >}}
    NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
details       ClusterIP   10.97.188.175   <none>        9080/TCP   3m
kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    154m
productpage   ClusterIP   10.110.184.42   <none>        9080/TCP   2m37s
ratings       ClusterIP   10.102.206.99   <none>        9080/TCP   2m59s
reviews       ClusterIP   10.106.21.117   <none>        9080/TCP   2m59s
{{< /output >}}

1.  Check that the pods are all up:

        kubectl get pods

1.  The expected output should look similar, with all pods running:

    {{< output >}}
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
details-v1-68fbb76fc-qfpbd        2/2     Running   0          4m48s
productpage-v1-6c6c87ffff-th52x   2/2     Running   0          4m15s
ratings-v1-7bdfd65ccc-z8grs       2/2     Running   0          4m48s
reviews-v1-5c5b7b9f8d-6xljj       2/2     Running   0          4m41s

reviews-v3-844bc59d88-pwl6b       2/2     Running   0          4m30s
{{< /output >}}

    {{< note >}}
If you do not see all pods running right away, you may need to wait a few moments for them to complete the initialization process.
{{< /note >}}

1.  Check that the `Bookinfo` application is running by issuing the following command which will pull the title tag and contents from the `/productpage` from the `ratings` pod:

        kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=ratings -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -c ratings -- curl productpage:9080/productpage | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"

1.  The expected output will look like this:

    {{< output >}}
&lt;title&gt;Simple Bookstore App&lt;/title&gt;
{{< /output >}}

### Open the Istio Gateway

1.  If you noticed above when checking the services, none had external IPs. This is because Kubernetes services are private by default, you will need to open a gateway in order to access the app from the web browser. To do this you will use an Istio Gateway.

    Here are the contents of the `bookinfo-gateway.yaml` file.

    {{< file "samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml" >}}
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: bookinfo-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use istio default controller
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: bookinfo
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - bookinfo-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        exact: /productpage
    - uri:
        prefix: /static
    - uri:
        exact: /login
    - uri:
        exact: /logout
    - uri:
        prefix: /api/v1/products
    route:
    - destination:
        host: productpage
        port:
          number: 9080
{{< /file >}}

  - In the `Gateway` section you are setting `server` and specifying the `port` and `protocol` that will be opened through the gateway. Note that the `name` must match Istio's [named service ports standardization scheme](https://istio.io/docs/setup/additional-setup/requirements/).
  - In the `Virtual Service` section, the `http` field defines how HTTP traffic will be routed, and the `destination` field says where requests are routed.

1.  Apply the ingress gateway with the following command:

        kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml

1.  You should see the following output:

    {{< output >}}
gateway.networking.istio.io/bookinfo-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/bookinfo created
{{< /output >}}

1.  Confirm the gateway is open:

        kubectl get gateway

1.  The output:

    {{< output >}}
NAME               AGE
bookinfo-gateway   1m
{{< /output >}}

1.  Determine if your Kubernetes cluster supports external load balancers:

        kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system

1.  The output should look similar to this:

    {{< output >}}
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)                                                                                                                                      AGE
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.97.218.128   23.92.23.198   15020:30376/TCP,80:31380/TCP,443:31390/TCP,31400:31400/TCP,15029:31358/TCP,15030:30826/TCP,15031:30535/TCP,15032:31728/TCP,15443:31970/TCP   21h
{{< /output >}}

    If `EXTERNAL-IP` has a value, then your cluster supports external load balancers and you can [open a gateway using that method](#open-a-gateway-with-the-external-load-balancer), if it's value is `<none>` or stays in `<pending>` then your environment does not provide an external load balancer for the ingress gateway. If this is the case, you will need to [open a gateway using the node port](#open-a-gateway-with-the-node-port).


### Apply Default Destination Rules

1.  Destination rules specify named service subsets and give them routing rules to control traffic to the different instances of your services. Apply the destination rules with the following command:

        kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all.yaml

1.  The output will appear as follows:

    {{< output >}}
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/productpage created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details created
{{< /output >}}

1.  You can view all the rules with this command:

        kubectl get destinationrules -o yaml

## Visualizations with Grafana

1.  In a terminal window that you can leave open, run this command to open the port for Grafana:

        kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=grafana -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') 3000:3000 &

1. If you're not using your local matching as your control node, create a new SSH tunnel from your local machine to your Linode with the following command so that you can access the localhost of your Linode, entering your credentials as prompted:


        ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 <username>@<ipaddress>

    Once this is completed, or if your control node is your local machine, visit the following site in your web browser:
