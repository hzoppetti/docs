### Docker Hub

A centralized container image registry that can host your images and make them available for sharing and deployment. You can also find and use official Docker images and vendor specific images. When combined with a remote version control service, like GitHub, [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) allows you to automate building container images and trigger actions for further automation with other services and tooling.
