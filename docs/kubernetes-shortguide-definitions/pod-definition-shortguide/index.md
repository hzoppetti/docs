### Pod

A [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.13/#pod-v1-core) is the smallest unit of the Kubernetes architecture, and is a group of one or more containers with shared resources and a specification for how to run these containers. Each pod has its own IP address and is mortal.
